<div class="paragraph">How to create issues and request features</div>

<p>
    Every ITSA-module has its own repository. Visit <a href="https://github.com/itsa" target="_blank">ITSA on GitHub</a> to see them all. Choose the  <code class="prettyprint">repository</code> you want to file an issue at. On the right you select  <code class="prettyprint">issues</code>. Now you click on the button <code class="prettyprint">New issue</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Should your issue or feature request happens to be denied, then don't feel sad or be insulted. We are trying to keep high quality and want to keep code that fits the goals of the project. We will always listen and respond the issue.
