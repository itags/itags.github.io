<div class="paragraph">How to start becoming a project-member</div>

<p>
    Being a project-member means you are owner an quardkeeper of ITSA's modules. Project-members are those who judge and merge pull requests. You can only become a project-member if you are asked to and if all current project-members agree. Also you need to be a proven project-contributor. All project-members have equal rights.
</p>
<p>
    The project-members follow the following rules:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="blue">Merging pull requests</span> will only be done when at least 2 project-members give positive advise and there is no negative advise</li>
        <li><span class="blue">New modules</span> need to conform the strategy and quality of ITSA's modules</li>
        <li><span class="blue">New project-members</span> can be proposed if all members agree</li>
    </ul>
