<div class="paragraph">How to contribute by occasion</div>

<p>
    One-time contribution is when you fork one of <code class="prettyprint">ITSA</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/itsa" target="_blank">repositories</a>, make changes or additions and create a pull request. This is something anyone can do. Most likely you will be making changes to the code or documentation.
</p>
<p>
    Changes to a code also leads into writing tests and updating documentation and API. The project-members will quarantee this is done before the code gets merged. If you feel like you want to contibute all aspects, or want to make additions, you better become a <a href="{{ project_contributor_url }}">project-contributor</a>.
